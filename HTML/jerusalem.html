    <h1>Jerusalem etymology</h1>

    <p>
        A city called Rušalim in the Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE) is widely,
        but not universally,
        identified as Jerusalem. Jerusalem is called Urušalim in the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE). The name
        "Jerusalem" is variously
        etymologized to mean "foundation (Sumerian yeru, 'settlement'/Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of
        the god Shalem", the god
        Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city. The form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim
        (Jerusalem) first appears in the
        Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of Yhwh Yir'eh ("God will see to
        it", the name given by
        Abraham to the place where he began to sacrifice his son) and the town “Shalem”.
